**Project Recovery – Exposing the Real Math Behind Online Slots**

This app lets you play a simple slot game that mirrors how real online slot machines actually work under the hood.

I can't copy-paste or clone the exact game (copyright reasons), but this version has the same core mechanics: weighted reels, payout tables, mixed wins, and that "almost there" feeling casinos love to give players.

**Purpose**  
Dedicated to anyone fighting the gambling devil inside them.  
This isn't just another boring slot toy.  
The real focus is the **math** — seeing exactly what happens behind the curtain, why you always feel like you're "so close" to winning big (which is mostly a lie), and how the house always wins long-term.

Play a few hundred spins, watch the RTP in action, and understand why casinos make money even when they pay out jackpots.

No cap — numbers don't lie.  
This is about facts, not hope.
